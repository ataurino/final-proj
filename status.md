Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

SO far, I have completed my outline, pulled an image, started the beginnings of writing the code.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I don't think I'm missing anything that I have not done or plan to do yet. I have a clear path and timeline of how I want to complete this.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None. So far so good.
