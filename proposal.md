# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

CincoConnect

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A connect 4 game but instead of needing to get 4 in a row, you will need to get 5. I may add another element but I am not sure of that yet.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The code will create a graphical game of conect 4 but with 5 instead. Two people should play the game and it will check for a winner after each move. It will end when there is a winner or the board fills up.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

For a good outcome, I would say I would want it to at least print out something similar to the exact end result. Even if the code does not run all the way.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For a better outcome, I would want to have it run somewhat, with my modification(s) working fully.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would, of course, it working fully with no bumps in the road and my modification(s) too.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps would definitley be to start to outline the code. Break it up into sections, make notes of what I know I need. I will probably reference concepts in the textbook to brush up on certain things. Since I am working by myself
I will be doing all of the work. I am going to split it up over weeks and chip away at it. I don't think I'm going to need to acquire any new skills, just polish some existing ones from class.
